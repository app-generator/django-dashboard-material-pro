<br />

## Prepare your environment

The product is built on top of [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), a popular Python Web Framework. To build the app, Python3 should be installed properly in the workstation. If you are not sure if Python is properly installed, please open a terminal and type `python --version`. The full-list with dependencies and tools required to build the app:

- [Python3](https://www.python.org/) - the programming language used to code the app
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - used to clone the source code from the Github repository
- A [Github](https://github.com/) account - the invitation to the source code, will be sent on your account.
- Basic development tools (g++ compiler, python development libraries ..etc) used by Python to compile the app dependencies in your environment.

<br />

> Check Python (using the terminal)

```bash
$ # Check Python version
$ python --version
Python 3.7 # <--- All good
```

<br />

> Check GIT command tool (using the terminal)

```bash
$ # Check git
$ git --version
$ git version 2.10 # <--- All good
```

<br />

## Project Structure

The boilerplate code is built with a modular structure that follows the recommended pattern used by many open-source projects. The most important files and  directories are shown below:

<br />

```bash
< PROJECT ROOT >                               # application root folder
    |
    |--- core/__init__.py                      # Handles the core features
    |--- core/                                 # define app settings and serve statis assets and pages
    |      | --- <templates>
    |      |        |---<includes>             # Page chunks, components
    |      |        |---<layouts>              # App Layouts (the master pages)
    |      |        |---<account>              # Auth Pages (login, register)
    |      |        |---<pages>                # App Pages
    |      |
    |      | --- views.py
    |      | --- urls.py
    |      | --- models.py
    |
    |--- app/__init__.py                       # Django app that serve the pages
    |--- app/                                  # for authenticated users
    |      | --- views.py
    |      | --- urls.py
    |      | --- models.py
    |
    |--- authentication/__init__.py            # Django app that serve the pages
    |--- authentication/                       # for authenticated users
    |      | --- forms.py                      # Login, Register forms
    |      | --- views.py
    |      | --- urls.py
    |      | --- models.py
    |
    |--- requirements.txt                      # Requirements - SQLite storage
    |
    |--- manage.py                             # bootstrap the app

### [What is dashboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(business))

In information technology, a **[dashboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(business))** is a user interface that, somewhat resembling an automobile's dashboard, organizes and presents information in a way that is easy to read. However, a computer dashboard is more likely to be interactive than an automobile dashboard (unless it is also computer-based). To some extent, most graphical user interfaces (GUIs) resemble a dashboard - by [Techtarget](https://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/dashboard)
